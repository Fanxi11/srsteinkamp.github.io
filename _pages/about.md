I am a data scientist and cognitive neuroscientist / psychologist by study, however, have gained my fair share of experience and knowledge in machine and deep learning.

My doctorate research was on the computational modeling of visual attention, most of it using neuroimaging (fMRI) in combination with dynamic causal modeling (DCM). During my masters I also used electrophysiological measures (EEG) for speech recovery, in combination with fMRI recordings.

During my master's degree I also started developing and coding in Python, Matlab, and R and started out on Kaggle, as well as different scientific hackathons on neuroimaging and climate change.

As I found the latter more exciting and interesting as my academic work -- especially, as it can have a larger (positive) impact on society -- I am now excited to start my career in data science!
