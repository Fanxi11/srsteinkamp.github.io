## Welcome

You are now on my landing page. From here you can go further to my blog / collection and other of my projects.

If you are interested, you can also find my CV and publications on this page.

## Blog / Portfolio
After using academic pages for a while, I decided to decouple some things.
This means now, my blog is created with fastpages and this page serves as a landing page and for general information.

## Projects

### pymtrf

My first "full-blown" project. For a class I decided to translate the MTRF-toolbox for Matlab to Python and unleash the fullstack of continuous integration and testing suits on it.

### Maskbinarizer

Currently I am using nbdev for developing, especially due to the easy creation of documentations.
This is a very basic command line tool, to binarize NIFTI files: IIRC, mricron outputs masks using RGB values, which is not handled for a popular lesion symptom mapping tool.

### Gabor Layers (in Tensorflow)

For the reproducibility challenge of Papers with code, I decided to take on the articl by Perez 2020, which uses Gabor filters as early layers in popular neural network architectures and proposes a new regularization for the process. In this repro I am trying to implmement the paper in tensorflow.
